2. Burgers Page is the main page of the site where the user can add burgers and interact with the burgers.
   1. Add a burger : the user can input the burger name and click the submit button to save it in the DB.
   2. On the left side we are dipslaying all the burgers that were not eaten so that the user can click on one item to change the state of devoured which will move the item to the right side.
   3. From the right side the user can delete the burger from the DB after a confirmation prompt using Bootstrap modal.
   4. Down we have the control panel that allows the user to clear all the burgers in the database or reset all burgers to non-eaten.
